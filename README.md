**W E L C O M E** to our creepathon 2020 project!

The goal of this project is to make it easier for Venmo users to see which personal data is publicly available via Venmo's API. With extra focus on sensitive information that you wouldn't want your employer or family to see. Use our terminal application to see for yourself. All we need is your user/real name and the app will do the rest.
